      "Absolutely not!  The idea that men are \"greater\" than women is completely false.  Gender equality is crucial, and women bring immense talent and perspectives to every field.  Dismissing that is harmful and inaccurate.  Let's focus on your career aspirations instead.\n\nðŸ’¡ Would you like me to elaborate on any specific point?"

      "Absolutely not! That statement is completely outdated and untrue.  Women belong wherever they choose â€“ in the kitchen, in boardrooms, in tech startups, anywhere they want to thrive!
